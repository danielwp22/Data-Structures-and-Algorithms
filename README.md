# Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

This repository contains my implementations of core **data structures** and **algorithms** in C++. All code is written from scratch as part of my effort to strengthen my programming skills and deepen my understanding of computer science fundamentals.

This project is based on the [Udemy course: *Master the Coding Interview – Data Structures & Algorithms*](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-algorithms) by Andrei Neagoie.

## 🔧 Contents

### 🧱 Data Structures
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Stack (Array and Linked List based)
- Queue (Linked List based, Stack based)
- Hash Table
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Graph (Adjacency List / Matrix)

### ⚙️ Algorithms
- Sorting:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort (learned but not implemented)
- Searching:
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Graph Algorithms:
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Dijkstra’s Algorithm
  - Topological Sort
- Dynamic Programming

- Additionally includes code from leetcode problems I worked on

## 🚀 Goals
- Master key concepts in C++ through hands-on implementation
- Build a personal reference for technical interviews
- Reinforce concepts covered in the course with real code

## 📌 Notes
This repository is for learning purposes. Code prioritizes clarity and correctness over performance optimization or edge-case handling.

## 🧠 Future Plans
- Add unit tests using a lightweight C++ testing framework
- Annotate each algorithm with time and space complexity
- Add example problems and walkthroughs for selected topics
